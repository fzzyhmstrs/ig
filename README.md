### What is it?
**An addon to Amethyst Imbuement that adds a variety of armor sets, weapons, tools, and other accessories not seen in the base mod!**

### Features Include
* Armor sets. Explore multiple new, flavorful armor sets that provide unique set bonuses to assist various spellcasting palystyles!
* Weapons. Craft and find brutal new weapons that sap the life from your opponents, dazzle them with celestial energy, and much more.
* Gear and Tools. New tool sets, trinkets, and miscellaneous equipment like new, unique arrows to help round out your build and arsenal.
* Elixirs. Craft powerful elixirs that provide everlasting potion effects, or at least until you fall in combat or travel to another world!
* Off Hands. More specialized and unique offhand items join the offering of AI. Class-specific offhands, as well as some that provide random, completely unique effects!

### Roadmap
For the first release, I have focused on the armor sets and some basic equipment. Future releases will flush out the features mentioned above, and maybe more!
