first there was nothingness
nothingness begets nothingness
so in its own image
void was born
first of its kind

void knew ony loneliness
it begged of nothingness
provide an escape
from the null existence
it brings only torment

nothingness was silent
for it is null
and nothingness
brings only nothingness
null and void

void grew desperate
it took jagged nix
and rent itself asunder
thus the saint was born
second of its kind

born of desperation
for something from nothing
the saint was creator
birth mother and origin
from saint all would come

and thus saint created
so in its own image
life was born
myriad and diverse
curious and bold

life is passion
passion is fire
a drive for renewal
thus the flame was born
third of its kind

as flame is passion
so it is destruction
wild and rampant
life was ravaged
innocent and unknowing

the saint wept
for its lifeblood
beset by flames
it reached out
to provide hope

from hope comes wit
thus knowledge was born
fourth of its kind
knowledge gave life
tools to survive

but tools have an edge
and from this edge
violence arose
thus the blade was born
fifth of its kind

the saint wept again
for life was now
destroying itself
hope become cruelty
survival become greed

cruelty and greed
begets depravity
evil and domination
thus the lich was born
sixth of its kind

the void became corrupted
driven mad by the cruelty
it lashed out
lashed at all existence
screamed and lashed

for eons and eons
life was drowned in darkness
the void manifest
null existence
threatened to return

the saint was bereaved
its creation stripped away
life on the brink
of utter nothingness
in kind the saint lashed out

blinding light
fury and rage and despair
contempt for the evils
and the darkness
endless light

thus the warrior was born
seventh of its kind
light incarnate
righteous fury and retribution
it clashed with the lich

their battle brought ruin
a struggle over existence
and the fate of life itself
blazing light and brutal dark
both bring destruction

so life was still in danger
three headed demons
horrors beyond knowing
sprang into existence
incarnations of struggle

and life was brought low
and life cried out
and life fled
and life seemed all but lost
but struggle brought one more

so the champion was born
eighth of its kind
protector of the meek
a savior to those
who have no power of their own

and the champion stood
upon the pillar
at the center of creation
and lofted its trident
let it loose upon its kind

and there was silence
the champions aim was true
and its kind were returned
to nothingness
returned to null existence

but life remained
the echo of its creator
and life found peace
and life stood in the silence
and life wept for the loss

but inside the echo
survived another echo
echo upon echo
the echo of the eight
the echo of the cosmos

the echo upon echo
took hold in creation
in the fabric of the echo
and gave power to that without
echoes of power in the echo

subtle power
whispering
whispering
whispering
awaiting those who could hear it

who will hear the whisper
who will feel the power
who will become the echo
the echo within the echo
who
